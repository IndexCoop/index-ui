# The Index DAO UI

Index DAO UI is a simple front-end used to interact with the Index DAO. This front-end describes the Index DAO and consolidates relevant links to onboard users onto the DAO's basic functionalities. It also allows users to stake, unstake, and claim INDEX tokens during the initial air drop + liquidity mining phase of the DAO's launch.

## Contributing

The main purpose of this repository is to continually serve the needs of the Index DAO, making it faster, simpler, and easier to use. As new proposals are submitted and the scope of Index DAOs governance evolves we anticipate this tool will change as well.
We greatly encourage any community contribution that may help the Index DAO reach more users and greater adoption.
