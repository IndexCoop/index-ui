# Index UI

Index UI is a simple front-end used to interact with Index. This front-end describes Index and consolidates relevant links to onboard users onto the protocol's basic functionalities. It also allows users to stake, unstake, and claim INDEX tokens during the initial distribution + liquidity mining phase of the protocol's launch.
