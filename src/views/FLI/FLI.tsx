            <strong>The Ethereum Flexible Leverage Index</strong> lets you
            leverage a collateralized debt position in a safe and efficient way,
            by abstracting its management into a simple index. It enables market
            participants to take on leverage while minimizing the transaction
            costs and risks associated with maintaining collateralized debt.
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            The Ethereum Flexible Leverage Index (ETH2X-FLI) makes leverage
            effortless. The end user does not have to worry about:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Monitoring their leveraged loan 24/7, having to always be ready
                to act.
              </li>

              <li>
                High fees, transactions not being included fast enough or the
                relative UIs being unresponsive during times of high volatility.
              </li>

              <li>
                Paying for overpriced stablecoins to deleverage on time or panic
                trading to save their positions.
              </li>

              <li>
                Users don't have to manage their liquidation ratio since this is
                automatically managed by FLI, which drastically reduces
                liquidations, even during black swan events.
              </li>
            </ul>
            ETH2X-FLI has several key advantages over Legacy Leveraged Tokens:
            <ul>
              <li>Zero slippage via composable entry and exit.</li>

              <li>
                Unique Index algorithm reduces rebalancing needs by an order of
                magnitude.
              </li>

              <li>
                Emergency deleveraging possible during Black Swan events for
                additional fund safety.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Initial Parameters:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Underlying Asset: ETH</li>
              <li>Target Leverage Ratio: 2</li>
              <li>DeFi Lending Protocol: Compound</li>
              <li>Maximum Leverage Ratio: 2.3</li>
              <li>Minimum Leverage Ratio: 1.7</li>
              <li>Recentering Speed: 5%</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Definitions:</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Borrow Rate — the cost to borrow the asset at the DeFi Lending
                Protocol over the most recent epoch.
              </li>
              <li>Epoch Length — the time between rebalances.</li>
              <li>
                Target Leverage Ratio (TLR) — the long term target for the value
                of the assets held by the index divided by the value of the debt
                held by the index.
              </li>
              <li>
                Current Leverage Ratio (CLR) — the value of the asset currently
                held by the index divided by the current value of the debt held
                by the index.
              </li>
              <li>
                Maximum Leverage Ratio (MAXLR) — the highest leverage ratio the
                index will ever have after a rebalance.
              </li>
              <li>
                Re-centering Speed (RS) — the rate at which the Current Leverage
                Ratio is adjusted each period to return to the Target Leverage
                Ratio, when the index is not being adjusted back to the Maximum
                Leverage Ratio or the Minimum Leverage Ratio.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Index Price:</h3>

              FLIt = FLIt-1 * (1 + ((Pricet/Pricet-1–1) * CLRt-1 — (BorrowRatet
              * (CLRt-1 -1)/CLRt-1)))
            </i>
            <h3>Calculation of the new Current Lever Ratio for the period:</h3>
            <i>CLRt+1 = max(MINLR, min(MAXLR, TLR * (1 — RS) + CLRt * RS))</i>
            <h2>Fees:</h2>
            Flexible Leverage Index has a streaming fee of 1.95% (195 basis
            points) and a 0.1% (10 basis points) mint/redeem fee. The revenue
            generated from the streaming fee is split 40% to DeFi Pulse and 60%
            to Index Coop.
