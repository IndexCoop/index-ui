            <strong>The DeFi Pulse Index</strong> is a capitalization-weighted
            index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets
            across the market.
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            The DeFi Pulse Index is a digital asset index designed to track
            tokens’ performance within the Decentralized Finance industry. The
            index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating
            supply. The DeFi Pulse Index aims to track projects in Decentralized
            Finance that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing
            maintenance and development.

              <h4>View the official methodology here.</h4>
            </ExternalLink>
            <h2>Token Inclusion Criteria</h2>
            The DeFi Pulse Index has a collection of criteria composed of four
            dimensions. Two dimensions are used to evaluate the token’s
            characteristics, one dimension is used to assess the project’s
            characteristics, and one is used to evaluate the protocol’s
            characteristics. The inclusion criteria are the basis to select what
            tokens will be included in the index.
            <h4>Token’s Descriptive Characteristics</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>The token must be available on the Ethereum blockchain.</li>
              <li>
                The token must be associated with a decentralized finance
                protocol or dapp listed on DeFi Pulse.
              </li>
              <li>
                The token must not be considered a security by the corresponding
                authorities across different jurisdictions.
              </li>
              <li>
                The token must be a bearer instrument. None of the following
                will be included in the index:Wrapped tokens. Tokenized
                derivatives. Synthetic assets. Tokens that are tied to physical
                assets. Tokens that represent claims on other tokens.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Token’s Supply Characteristics</h4>
            It must be possible to reasonably predict the token’s supply over
            the next five years. At least 5% of the five year supply must be
            currently circulating. The token’s economics must not have locking,
            minting or other patterns that would significantly disadvantage
            passive holders.
            <h4>Project’s Traction Characteristics</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The project must be widely considered to be building a useful
                protocol or product.Projects focused on competitive
                trading/holding, having Ponzi characteristics, or projects that
                exist primarily for entertainment, will not be included.
              </li>
              <li>The project’s protocol must have significant usage.</li>
              <li>
                The protocol or product must have been launched at least 180
                days before being able to qualify to be included in the index.
              </li>
              <li>The protocol or project must not be insolvent.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Protocol’s User Safety Characteristics</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Security professionals must have reviewed the protocol to
                determine that security best practices have been followed to
                maintain user assets safe under different
                circumstances.Alternatively, the protocol must have been
                operating long enough to create a consensus about its safety in
                the decentralized finance community.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the event of a safety incident, the team must have responded
                promptly and addressed the incident responsibly in the
                aftermath, providing users of the protocol with a reliable
                solution and the decentralized finance community with adequate
                documentation to provide transparency about the incident.
              </li>
              <li>
                The selected tokens must have sufficient liquidity across a
                variety of trading platforms.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Index Calculations</h2>
            <StyledDpiIndexCalculationImage src={DpiIndexCalculationImage} />
            The Index value is the spot value of the index.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Circulating Supply</strong> is the number of tokens
                circulating the last time circulating supply was determined. The
                first circulating supply was determined on September 8, 2020,
                using CoinGecko as a reference source.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Price</strong> is the market price of the token in USD.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Index Divisor</strong> is a constant that is adjusted on
                each rebalance. As of September 31, 2020, the Divisor was
                <strong>44679560.64</strong>.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Index Maintenance</h2>
            The index is maintained monthly in two phases:
            <h4>Determination Phase</h4>
            The determination phase takes place during the third week of the
            month. It is the phase when the changes needed for the next
            reconstitution are determined.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Circulating Supply Determination:</strong> The DeFi
                Pulse Index currently references CoinGecko’s circulating supply
                number. The Circulating Supply is determined during the third
                week of the month and published before the monthly
                reconstitution.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Additions and deletions:</strong> The tokens being added
                and deleted from the index calculation are determined during the
                third week of the month and published before monthly
                reconstitution.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Reconstitution Phase</h4>
            The index components are adjusted, added and deleted as per the
            instructions published after the end of the determination phase. New
            index weights, additions and deletions are incorporated into the
            index during the monthly reconstitution, which will take place on
            the first business day of the month. As assets tracked by the index
            grow, the reconstitution window will expand to more than one day to
            lower the reconstitution’s market impact.
