              <span>By bringing the collective minds of the worldâ€™s experts in finance and indexes, we can create and maintain the worldâ€™s best and most widely adopted crypto indices.</span>
              <span>These minds will collaborate to add/remove index vehicles, improve rebalance execution criteria, model out and discuss index composition, etc.</span>
              <span>This DAO has the potential to be one of the worldâ€™s largest capital allocators and the decisions made in this DAO can be potentially influence the movement of billions of dollars</span>
