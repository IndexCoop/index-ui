              <span>INDEX is a governance token used to determine the components of the Index DAO. Members who hold INDEX are able to make proposals to the <ExternalLink href="https://forum.theindexdao.com/">Index Governance Forum</ExternalLink> to propose new index weightings. The DeFi Pulse Index Set follows the Index DAO's allocations, and rebalances to the new allocations over time.</span>
